# Pokemon Python

## A console application

As a guy who grew up in the Nintendo era, video games always fascinated me. This, and the fact that my parents were always tell me to read a book, led me to an interest in choose your own adventure games as well. 

To combine my love for both, I've recreated the first part of the original Pokemon Gameboy game into a choose your own adventure for the console. It's short at the moment, but I had so much fun with it, I may try to do a more complex version in the future.

## Features

You're able to choose your own Pokemon, each with its own abilities. There is even an easter egg to get Pikachu.

## Tech use

This uses strictly Python.

## Try it yourself

Clone this repository 

``` git clone https://github.com/joncancode/console-adventure.git```

In order to run this, it would be best to create a virtual environment (but not necessary).

```python3 -m venv env```

to activate the environment
```source env/bin/activate```

to play the game, run:
```python3 game.py```

then deactivate in the console when you are done
```deactivate```
